# StarLight-newscript

This is a little program which uses your IP address to find your location, and then display the weather, date and time, and news articles 
by the category of your choosing. This program uses different apis for the weather, and the news. I have removed my api keys from the code and instead left the string empty for anyone else to use their own api keys instead. 

News api:   newsapi.org 
Weather api: openweathermap.org/api 

You have to run main.py for the program. 

This was my first go at using api's to create an interactive program. I at the time did not have any knowledge about databases and how to
use them, thus I resorted to using what was within my abilities at the time to store user information (Text Files).

I plan on revisiting this project once I have knowledge of database usage and creating this is a webpage.
